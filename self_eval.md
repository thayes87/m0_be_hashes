# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
*the commas after the values tripped me up multiple times, I have to remember them or they will be the cause of my death!

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
*I can't say that I'm taking a lot of detailed notes, rather using replit and atom to try and duplicate the work in the curriculum. I have been referencing past lessons frequently, this might be a bit of a time suck but it is working really well for me. I do write down each of the vocabulary words in the beginning of the lesson and tick them off as I learn them. I'll more than likely create some note cards before mod1 so I can get better at memorizing the terminology.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
*This was the lesson I felt the most comfortable in and had the most enjoyable experience. I made a concerted effort to type in my own code for each challenge BEFORE going to google. I was actually much closer than I thought I would be and my code only required a few tweaks. This was a great productive struggle!
